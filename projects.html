      <h1 id="flow">Women's Rights to Sustainable Livelihood Project (FLOW)</h1>
      The women’s rights to sustainable livelihood project is a multi-country project implemented in Ghana and Rwanda and funded by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Netherlands under the funding Leadership and Opportunities for Women (FLOW) fund. In Ghana the project is implemented under auspices of ActionAid Ghana in Partnership with Songtaba, Widows and Orphans Movement and Bonatadu

      It is a three and half year food security and women’s rights project that will provide practical solutions to reduce the unpaid care work of women smallholder farmers as part of a comprehensive approach to improving women famers’ productivity, household food and nutrition security and increasing their ability to engage with duty bearers to provide social services that will recognize, redistribute and reduce their unpaid care work.

      Project goal
      <ul>
        <li>To support the collective organization and political engagement of women farmers</li>
        <li>To reduce the drudgery of unpaid care work among women</li>
        <li>Improving food and nutrition security</li>
        <li>Promoting evidence based research on women smallholder farmers’ multiple roles to inform national and international advocacy</li>
      </ul>

      Project beneficiaries:

      3000 women smallholder farmers in Nanumba North and South District in the northern region and Talinsi, Nabdam districts in the upper east region

      Project expected outcomes:

      Outcome one: 300 women smallholder farmers in 2 Local Rights Programmes in Ghana are organised and their work as farmers and carers is recognised by the community

      Outcome two: 3000 women smallholder farmers meet regularly with local and national policy makers and engage in planning and budgeting processes to demand more resources to support them in food production and unpaid care work as outlined in Outcomes 3 &amp; 4 by the end of 2015.

      Outcome three: Hours spent by women on unpaid care work are significantly reduced as a result of low cost pilot interventions such as community-run childcare centres, household rainwater storage, and community tree lots for firewood by the end of 2015.

      Outcome four: 3000 women smallholder farmers have more secure and sustainable access to food and are producing increased surplus for sale by the end of 2015.

      Outcome five: Greater visibility of women’s unpaid care work and farming activities leads to an increase in donor, regional and international commitments to support rural women smallholder farmers by 2015.
